<p>The Winnipeg chapter of Papers We Love</p>

<p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss in a low ego, friendly environment.</p>

At issue is the claim that the machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their contributions of efficiency and productivity, not merely for their positive and negative environmental side effects, but also for the ways in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority. Since ideas of this kind have a persistent and troubling presence in discussions about the meaning of technology, they deserve explicit attention.</p> <p><b>Presenter Bio:</b></p> <p>Brittany Postnikoff is an undergraduate computer science student focusing on Human-Robot Interaction and security at the University of Manitoba…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Winnipeg/events/226080050/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

In this treatment a few general assumptions are made concerning the behaviour of a single individual and of a group of two individuals in certain economic environments. From these, the solution (in the sense of this paper) of the classical problem may be obtained.

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest-neighbour indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by fi…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Winnipeg/events/221603856/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

<i>The creation of interactive worlds, such as those in video games, often include a set of computer controlled characters that must intelligently act and react in response to dynamic input from the user. These interactive behaviours usually require authors to programmatically define each behaviour, reaction, and interaction the character should take in response to user input across a range of scenarios, a process that can take significant time. While this method can successfully create robust characters, the large development overhead is not conducive to the exploration, prototyping, and testing of new character ideas.</i></p> <p><i>We designed and developed PaintBoard, a system that enables users to…</i></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Winnipeg/events/220117454/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
