To fully leverage the potential patterns hidden in the petabytes of DNA and RNA sequence information requires the use of machine learning algorithms and specialised kernels, which can capture the valuable domain knowledge provided by biological scientists. A common problem in computational biology is that of binary classification. Support vector machines (SVMs) have achieved good results in this domain and have thus been eagerly adopted by computational biology researchers.

Finally, a breakthrough came by sharing ideas from category theory to bring monads into functional programming, as a way to model and manage side effects. However, little has been done to ensure that entire interaction sequences <i>make sense</i>. For example, many functional programming languages will allow you to open a file handle, close it, and then try and read from it - clearly a nonsensical sequence of operations! In "Kleisli Arrows of Outrageous Fortune", Conor McBride shows us how we can borrow more ideas from the literature, introducing a new formulation of <i>indexed monads</i> - a structure with close connections to slice categories. Given these new tools, he demonstrates that these monads can correspond to enf…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/222094026/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Relational programming, or logic programming, is a programming paradigm that exhibits remarkable and powerful properties, to the extent that its implementation seems frightfully daunting to the layman. µKanren is a minimal relational language that seeks to strip the paradigm down to its core, leaving us with a succinct, elegant and above all <i>simple</i> set of primitives on top of which we can rebuild even the most powerful relational constructs.</p> <p>In this talk, we will explore the µKanren language by implementing it from first principles in a simple functional programming language, going on to demonstrate how you can assemble these simple building blocks into a semblance of its richer parent, miniKanren, and maybe solve a logic puzzle or two to make sure it’s working as advertised.</p> <p>The µKanren paper, and the original µKanren implementation, were authored by Jason Hemann and Daniel P.

          <p><b>Equal Rights for Functional Objects, or, The More Things Change, the More they Stay the Same</b></p> <p>There are many ways of defining equality, particularly in a language which has both object-oriented and functional aspects. There's reference equality, numerical equality, shallow list equality, deep list equality, string equality, and even "fuzzy" floating-point equality. Which is the right to choose in any given situation? Which should i use for my equals() method on my custom object?</p> <p>This paper answers all of these questions, by taking a seemingly complex problem and revealing an underlying simplicity. It does this by defining one equality operation that works in any situation.</p> <p>The paper makes use of lisp syntax, but the ideas are applicable to most modern languages.</p> <p>






Can anyone sponsor pizza and drinks? Makes it much easier for me to host more things at uSwitch if someone else covers the food.</p>… <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/170910742/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
