          <p>Peter Zion will present two great papers on deep learning; first, Yann LeCun’s seminal 1998 paper, "<a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf">Gradiant-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition</a>", which will give some background and context for Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton's 2012 paper, "<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/imagenet.pdf">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</a>", in which (to quote Peter), "they [...] create a GPU-based DNN that is better at image recognition than any human".</p> <p>


Given the length of the first paper, I recommend reading Krizhevsky's paper in detail, and skimming LeCun's paper as needed for background.</p> <p>


Everyone interested in machine learning, image processing and recognition, or GPU computing should come!</p> <p>


This event is part of <a href="http://mtldata.com/bdw">Big Data Week</a>.  Be sure to check out the rest of the schedule!</p> <p>


Finally, a huge thanks…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Montreal/events/221545922/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Pablo Duboue will present "<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/zero.pdf">Structural Zeros versus Sampling Zeros</a>" by Mohri and Roark; this looks like a fascinating paper with applicability to improving all kinds of probabilistic models.  He will also be talking about the specific application of this idea to probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parsing as discussed in another Mohri and Roark paper, "<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/spcfg.pdf">Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar Induction Based on Structural Zeros</a>".  Anyone interested in machine learning, natural language processing, parsing in general, even automated test generation and model checking, or all kinds of other topics should definitely attend!</p> <p>



I apologize for the delay in announcing this meetup.  I was in Toronto checking out their PWL chapter to hopefully borrow some ideas (and speakers!) and lost track of time.</p> <p>

While the relevance of this to people involved in machine learning or targeted search is clear, I would imagine there will be interesting discussion for anyone who has to deal with problems where heuristics are hard to come up with ahead of time.</p> <p>

          <p>I'm going to talk about shape grammars (split grammars, place grammars), in particular their application to procedural 3D content generation as presented in the paper "Procedural Modeling of Buildings" by Müller, Wonka, et al.  This was a landmark paper (along with the 2003 "Instant Architecture") that is still the state of the art in some ways.  There might be some digression into general grammar-driven generation, especially for automatic test generation, since it's a broad and interesting topic.</p> <p>
