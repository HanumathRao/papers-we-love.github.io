          <p>Trevor Lalish-Menagh will present "A Critique of the CAP Theorem." Abstract:</p> <p>The CAP Theorem is a frequently cited impossibility result in distributed systems, especially among NoSQL distributed databases. In this paper we survey some of the confusion about the meaning of CAP, including inconsistencies and ambiguities in its definitions, and we highlight some problems in its formalization. CAP is often interpreted as proof that eventually consistent databases have better availability properties than strongly consistent databases; although there is some truth in this, we show that more careful reasoning is required. These problems cast doubt on the utility of CAP as a tool for reasoning about trade-offs in practical systems. As alternative to CAP, we propose a "delay-sensitivity" framework, which analyzes the sensitivity of operation latency to network delay, and which may help practitioners reason about the trade-offs between consistency guarantees and tolerance of network fa…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/226493450/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

This is a patent pending technology that analyzes voice data and predicts human emotions elicited by the paralinguistic elements of a voice.</p> <p>Human voice characteristics, such as tone, complement the verbal communication. In several contexts of communication, “how” things are said is just as important as “what” is being said. This paper provides an overview of our deployed system, the raw data, the data processing steps, and the prediction algorithms we experimented with.

These Hash Trees require no initial root hash table yet are faster and use significantly less space than chained or double hash trees. Insert, search and delete times are small and constant, independent of key set size, operations are O(1). Small worst-case times for insert, search and removal operations can be guaranteed and misses cost less than successful searches. Array Mapped Tries(AMT), first described in Fast and Space Efficient Trie Searches, Bagwell [2000], form the underlying data structure. The concept is then applied to external disk or distributed storage to obtain an algorithm that achieves single access searches, close to single access inserts and greater than 80 percent disk block load factors.

          <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>We present Mesos, a platform for sharing commodity clusters between multiple diverse cluster computing frameworks, such as Hadoop and MPI. Sharing improves cluster utilization and avoids per-framework data replication. Mesos shares resources in a fine-grained manner, allowing frameworks to achieve data locality by taking turns reading data stored on each machine. To support the sophisticated schedulers of today's frameworks, Mesos introduces a distributed two-level scheduling mechanism called resource offers. Mesos decides how many resources to offer each framework, while frameworks decide which resources to accept and which computations to run on them. Our results show that Mesos can achieve near-optimal data locality when sharing the cluster among diverse frameworks, can scale to 50,000 (emulated) nodes, and is resilient to failures.</p> <p><b><br></b></p> <p><b>Presenter:</b></p> <p>Ankur Chauhan</p> <p><b>Links:</b></p> <p></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/224064458/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Derek Elkins will present on "Dedalus: Datalog in Time and Space" touching also on some follow-on work.</p> <p><b>Abstract. </b></p> <p>Recent research has explored using Datalog-based languages to express a distributed system as a set of logical invariants. Two properties of distributed systems proved difficult to model in Datalog. First, the state of any such system evolves with its execution. Second, deductions in these systems may be arbitrarily delayed, dropped, or reordered by the unreliable network links they must traverse. Previous efforts addressed the former by extending Datalog to include updates, key constraints, persistence and events, and the latter by assuming ordered and reliable delivery while ignoring delay. These details have a semantics outside Datalog, which increases the complexity of the language and its interpretation, and forces programmers to think operationally. We argue that the missing component from these previous languages is a notion of time.</p> <p>I…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/223224228/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

The approach is intended for supporting large-scale storage services that exhibit high throughput and availability without sacrificing strong consistency guarantees. Besides outlining the chain replication protocols themselves, simulation experiments explore the performance characteristics of a prototype implementation.

<b>Abstract</b></p> <p>





Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.</p> <p>

          <p>After a long reign as the dominant on-disk data structure for databases and filesystems, B-trees are slowly being replaced by write-optimized data structures, to handle ever-growing volumes of data. Some write optimization techniques, like LSM-trees, give up some of the query performance of B-trees in order to achieve this.</p> <p>This time I will cover B-Trees, LSM Trees and Fractal Trees papers and provide some real world use cases (and data) along with the a discussion on the respective papers.</p>… <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/215859342/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Immutable vectors are a convenient data structure for functional programming and part of the standard library of modern languages like Clojure and Scala. The common implementation is based on wide trees with a fixed number of children per node, which allows fast indexed lookup and update operations. In this paper, the authors extend the vector data type with a new underlying data structure, Relaxed Radix Balanced Trees (RRB-Trees), and show how this structure allows immutable vector concatenation, insert-at and splits in O(logN) time while maintaining the index, update and iteration speeds of the original vector data structure.</p> <p><br>Chris Bilson will be presenting this paper followed by a Q&amp;A session.</p> <p>Link: &lt;a&gt;RRB-Trees: Efficient Immutable Vectors&lt;/a&gt;</p>… <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/209319592/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
